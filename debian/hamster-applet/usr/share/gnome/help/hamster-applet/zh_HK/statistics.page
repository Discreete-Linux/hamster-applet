<p>
    The results that are accessible via the
    <gui style="button">Show Statistics</gui> link are experimental and
    they are an interpretation of the facts. This interpretation should be compared
    with your own observations. Patches are welcome.

    However, the "Starts and Ends" should give you some idea about your active
    time.
